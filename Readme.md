# Maniafix

Fixes issues in ManiaPlanet by patching the game in-memory.

## Install

1. Compile or download [a release](https://github.com/angelog/maniafix/releases).
2. Extract the files into your Maniaplanet folder (where `Maniaplanet.exe` is).
3. Run `ManiafixLauncher.exe`, which will launch the game. If you launch the game via this executable, the patches will be applied.

## Fixes
